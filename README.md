| No admin rights / installs | Use **Google Colab** (runs in browser, no install needed)                  |
| Little coding experience   | I’ll give you a **plug-and-play script** with clear comments               |
| Low or no budget           | Open-source tools only (Playwright, GitHub API, etc.)                      |
| Static login               | We’ll use **Playwright headless browser** to log in with username/password |
| GitHub automation needed   | We'll use **GitHub REST API** to push changes and open PRs                 |
